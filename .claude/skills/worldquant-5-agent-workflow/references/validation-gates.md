# Validation Gates — 4-Stage Funnel for Agent 4

This file is the mandatory pre-submission checklist for Agent 4 (Backtest
Operator). It exists because syntax-clean code can still produce **silent
zero-signal backtests** and **semantically wrong results** — the two most
common failure modes we have seen in practice and the ones reported across
recent LLM-quant benchmarks.

Treat this as a funnel: a batch must pass every gate before Agent 4 hands
off to Agent 5. A gate failure does NOT mean rerun-blindly; it means feed
the structured error back to Agent 3 (see `## Retry loop` below).

---

## Background — why these gates exist

Two independent benchmark results motivate this file:

1. **QuantCode-Bench (Lime, 2026)** — collected 400 strategy tasks and ran
   them through a 4-stage funnel: syntax check → runs without error →
   actually trades → behavioral fidelity. Best single-shot model passed
   only ~76%. With multi-round retry and structured error feedback (up to
   10 attempts), pass rate reached 95-98%.
2. **AlphaForgeBench (2026)** — LLMs used as direct traders showed neurotic
   and self-contradictory behavior; LLMs used as factor/expression
   generators (reasoning separated from execution) were stable and useful.

Translation for this workflow:
- Agent 3 IS the factor generator (reasoning). Keep it that way.
- Agent 4 IS the harness. Its job is to catch the 24% silent-failure tail
  **before** Agent 5 ever sees a corrupt result.
- Cheap 5-round retries with structured errors beat one perfect prompt.

## What this funnel does NOT catch (dogfood retrospective)

This funnel was retroactively tested against the Round 1 failure of session
`logs/20260423_a_share_asset_growth_investment/` (the Asset Growth factor
that went -1.5 Sharpe in 2020 on all 8 variants, despite +0.6 to +0.8 LS
Sharpe on the full 2020-2025 window). **All 8 variants would have passed
G1, G2, and G3; 7 of 8 would have passed G4.** Only `f6_ag_qoq_ind` fails
G4 on near-zero IC sign.

The Round 1 death was:
- Q5 had ~900 stocks per day (healthy)
- IC sign correct (`-AG` → positive IC, monotone across {1, 5, 20, 60} day
  horizons from 0.005 → 0.042 — a textbook slow-fundamental signature)
- No exception, no zero-signal, no direction flip
- Just one catastrophic year (2020 A-share small-cap rally destroyed the
  high-AG short leg — Pitfall 7) buried under 5 decent years (Pitfall 3
  "N/N positive years" masking)

Conclusion: **this 4-gate funnel is orthogonal to regime-concentrated
failures.** Those are already caught by the worst-year-Sharpe floor in
`SKILL.md` mandatory audit 3 and by the per-year reporting in
`common-pitfalls.md` Pitfall 3 / Pitfall 7. Don't expect G1–G4 to save
you from "the code is correct but the market hated this factor in one
specific year".

What this funnel DOES catch is the disjoint failure class: **code-level
bugs that produce plausible-looking but meaningless numbers**. Examples
that would trip G3/G4 even on an otherwise-sound Agent 3 output:

| Hypothetical bug | Caught by |
|---|---|
| Staleness filter tightened from 200d to 30d → Q5 shrinks to ~50 stocks | G3 "Q5 ≥ 30 on 95% of days" |
| `shift(8)` accidentally written as `shift(-8)` (uses future balance sheet) | G4 IC sign flip vs thesis |
| Industry column has NaN rows → `groupby` silently drops them → coverage collapses | G3 "unique names ≥ 3× portfolio size" |
| Winsor hardcoded to `clip(-1, 1)` instead of `quantile(0.01, 0.99)` | G4 decile monotonicity degradation |
| All-equal input into winsor+z → `std == 0` → constant signal | G3 "signal std > 0 on 99% of days" |
| Thesis claimed 20d signal but IC peaks at 1d (factor is really a 1d micro-signal) | G4 horizon consistency |

If a failure resembles the Round 1 case (per-year variance with a single
bad year dragging the mean into doubt), the answer is the worst-year
floor and the falsification prompt from `common-pitfalls.md` Pitfall 5,
not this funnel. Use the right tool for the right failure mode.

## The 4 gates

Every one of the 8 expressions in a batch must pass gates G1–G4. If any
expression fails, the WHOLE batch returns to Agent 3 for repair.

### G1 — Importable & syntactically sound

Trivial in modern setups but still non-zero. Grep for the usual culprits:

- `import` statements resolve (no missing package)
- Parquet columns referenced actually exist in `.cache/*.parquet`
- Tushare endpoint names are real (`daily`, `daily_basic`, `balancesheet`,
  `stock_basic`, etc. — not hallucinated)
- No f-string syntax errors, unbalanced brackets, stale variable names

**Failure mode**: trivially obvious. Fix by re-reading the expression.

### G2 — Runs end-to-end without exception

The script must complete a full backtest loop without raising. Common
silent-killer exceptions:

- `KeyError` on a column that was renamed between caches
- `ValueError` when winsor/zscore is applied to an all-NaN column
- `TypeError` on `np.polyfit` when residualization input is all-NaN
- `IndexError` from `shift(N)` when there is insufficient history
- Timezone mismatch in `merge_asof`
- `numpy.linalg.LinAlgError` from a singular matrix

**Failure mode**: the script raises. Fix the specific line.

### G3 — Non-degenerate backtest (the critical gate)

This is the one that catches the 17.8% "zero-signal" silent-failure class.
The backtest ran, but it didn't actually do anything meaningful. Required
invariants:

| Invariant | Threshold | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Non-NaN signal coverage per date | ≥ 50 stocks on ≥ 90% of trading days | Below this, cross-section is too sparse for stable z-scores |
| Q5 membership size per date | ≥ 30 stocks on ≥ 95% of trading days | Below this, Q5 return is dominated by 1-2 names and Sharpe is noise |
| Annual turnover | 10% ≤ turnover ≤ 2000% | Below 10%: signal is frozen (always-long). Above 2000%: factor is noise-driven |
| Fraction of trading days with zero rebalancing | ≤ 5% | Sustained zero-rebalance days usually means the signal collapsed to a tie |
| Unique Q5 names over full window | ≥ 3× headline portfolio size | Below this, the "portfolio" is the same handful of names forever — essentially a static bet |
| Signal std(cross-section) per date | > 0 on ≥ 99% of days | Catches the "all stocks get the same score" bug (usually from a broken neutralization) |
| **Net Sharpe at declared cost assumption** | **> -0.5 annualized** | **Added after 20260423 BTC 1m dogfood. The `trade_freq` gate is a proxy — a direct check against Pitfall 10 "costs wipe the signal" is decisive. Use whatever cost Agent 2 declared in `session_metadata.yml` (default: 5 bps per side equities, 5 bps per side crypto taker). Net Sharpe well below zero means the factor is cost-unviable regardless of IC t-stat.** |

Optional but strongly recommended:

- Plot Q5 vs Q1 cumulative returns on a single chart before declaring
  success. A flat Q5-Q1 line with non-zero Sharpe is almost always a
  zero-trade artifact.

**Failure mode**: script completes, numbers exist, but they don't
represent an actual strategy. This is the single most-expensive class of
bug because it looks like success.

### G4 — Behavioral fidelity

The expression does what Agent 2's economic thesis said it would do.
Verify by checking SIGNED invariants:

- **Sign of IC matches thesis**: if the thesis said "low investment →
  high future return", the IC of the unsigned factor vs `fwd_ret` must
  be NEGATIVE. If positive, the expression has the sign wrong. (Rule of
  thumb: always negate at source so "high signal = long" holds by
  construction.)
- **Monotonicity across deciles**: Q1 < Q2 < ... < Q5 on average return
  over the full window. Allow one inversion (e.g., Q3/Q4 crossed) but
  not two. Non-monotonic factors are either too weak for deployment or
  have a bug.
- **Horizon consistency with neutralization claim**: if `session_metadata.yml`
  claims "industry-neutralized 20-day horizon", IC at 20d must be
  materially larger than IC at 1d (otherwise the factor is really
  a 1-day signal with noise).
- **No trivial classic-factor clone**: compute |corr| with size, 20d
  momentum, and the universe-EW return. If any |corr| > 0.85, the
  "new" factor is not new — it is the classic factor renamed.

**Failure mode**: the factor is real but different from the thesis. Agent
5 would later catch this with correlation analysis, but catching it here
saves a round.

### G5 — Batch-level horizon consistency (meta-gate)

G1–G4 are per-expression. They cannot catch the failure mode where **all
8 expressions fail G4 for the same reason because Agent 2 mis-specified
the primary horizon**. The 20260423 BTC 1m dogfood hit exactly this: 4
of 8 expressions flipped IC sign at k=5m because 5m fell between the
microstructure-reversal regime (<2m) and the slower mean-reversion
regime (~15m) — the mechanism was real, just at the wrong horizon.

G5 is a single check run AFTER all 8 expressions have been gated:

| Invariant | Threshold | Why |
|---|---|---|
| At least half of expressions that passed G4 have their peak IC at the declared primary horizon | ≥ 4 of the surviving 8 | If the batch majority says "peak is elsewhere", the hypothesis, not the code, is broken. |
| Among surviving expressions, the peak-IC horizon is consistent (same horizon for ≥ 60% of them) | — | Catches "each expression says a different horizon is best" — i.e., no coherent mechanism. |

**If G5 fails**, DO NOT retry expressions. The failure is at Agent 2,
not Agent 3. Return the batch to Agent 2 with a one-line diagnostic:
"batch IC peak is at k=X, not the declared k=Y. Re-specify primary
horizon or mechanism." Agent 2 issues a revised `session_metadata.yml`,
Agent 3 may keep most expressions unchanged but re-target the new k.

**What G5 does not do**: G5 does not protect against Agent 2 picking a
wrong *mechanism* — if the whole thing is momentum when Agent 2 claims
reversal, every expression's IC sign flips, which G4 catches. G5 only
catches the more subtle "right mechanism, wrong horizon" failure.

---

## Retry loop (Agent 3 ↔ Agent 4)

If gates G1–G4 fail, DO NOT re-run the same expression hoping for better
luck. Feed the structured error back to Agent 3 with a bounded retry
budget.

### Retry contract

- **Budget**: up to 5 rounds per batch. After round 5, promote the batch
  to RESEARCH-ONLY and document the residual failure mode — do not
  silently drop failing expressions to get to 8.
- **Error payload**: `working/agent4_repair_NNNN.json` with the schema:
  ```json
  {
    "retry_round": 2,
    "expression_id": "r3_ag_orth_nsi",
    "failed_gate": "G3",
    "invariant": "Q5 membership size",
    "observed": 12,
    "threshold": 30,
    "diagnostic_snippet": "Q5 size by quarter: 2020Q1=8 2020Q2=11 2020Q3=14 ...",
    "suspected_cause": "staleness filter of 60 days is too tight; most stocks have staleness 90-180 days for annual reports",
    "suggested_fix": "relax staleness to 200 days OR use merge_asof with backward direction"
  }
  ```
- **Hand back to Agent 3**: the expression + the error payload. Agent 3
  returns a revised expression (counting against the retry budget), NOT
  a brand new one. Brand new expressions start a new batch.

### What Agent 3 should NOT do on retry

- Loosen thresholds in Agent 4's validator to make the gate pass. If G3
  fails because Q5 is too thin, fix the expression; do not lower the
  Q5 floor.
- Swap mechanism mid-retry. If the expression is fundamentally the wrong
  mechanism, that's a round decision, not a retry decision.
- Silently remove problematic dates from the panel. "Drop 2020" is not
  a fix; it is a confession that the factor is regime-dependent.

### When to stop retrying and escalate

- 2 consecutive retries fail the same gate with the same invariant →
  escalate to Agent 5 for round-level decision (pivot mechanism, change
  horizon, drop mechanism, etc.).
- Retry count ≥ 5 for any single expression → mark that expression as
  RESEARCH-ONLY in the batch report; do not promote to Agent 5 as a
  candidate.

---

## Handoff augmentation

`handoff_4_to_5.json` MUST include the per-expression gate table:

```json
{
  "expressions": [
    {
      "id": "r3_ag_orth_nsi",
      "gates": {"G1": "pass", "G2": "pass", "G3": "pass", "G4": "pass"},
      "retry_count": 1,
      "notes": "G3 initially failed on Q5 size; relaxed staleness gate to 200 days"
    }
  ]
}
```

Agent 5 is allowed to downgrade any candidate whose `retry_count > 2`
regardless of headline metrics, because high retry counts correlate with
fragile implementations.

---

## Relationship to other reference files

- `common-pitfalls.md` — documents real post-hoc failures. G3/G4 are
  designed to catch Pitfalls 1, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 *before* they reach Agent 5.
- `execution-delay-audit.md` — runs INSIDE gate G4 as a specific fidelity
  check for the delay invariant.
- `execution-plan.md` — the retry loop described here slots between
  Step 3 and Step 4 of the coordinator procedure.
- `tvt-split-template.md` — runs AFTER all four gates pass, on the subset
  of candidates Agent 5 keeps.

---

## One-line summary

If Agent 4 hands anything to Agent 5 without a clean G1/G2/G3/G4 table
(and a G5 batch-level pass) in `handoff_4_to_5.json`, the workflow is
operating in pre-funnel mode and every downstream decision is suspect.
